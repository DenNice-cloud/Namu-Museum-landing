# Project Description: Art Museum Landing Page
I created a landing page for the "Art Museum" according to a Figma design.

## Key Features
- **Responsive Design:** Implemented according to the Figma design specifications for various screen sizes.
- **Font Styles:** Utilized IBM Plex Sans and Montserrat fonts.
- **BEM and SCSS:** Followed BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology and used SCSS for styling.

## Sections
### Header:
 - Photo of the Museum with clickable button 'events' and 'tickets'.
 - Three bars that open a sidebar menu with site navigation and the museum's schedule. Each menu item is clickable and takes you to a section of the page.
### "Art Museum" Block:
 - An introductory section about the museum.
### "Topical events" Block:
 - Contains two similar blocks:
    - I go and return,
    - Argue and dream.
### "From Classicism to Romanticism" Block:
 - Section from Classicism to Romanticism with the same background for this block.
### "Gallery" Block:
 - A gallery section with a few demostration pictures.
### "Subscription" Block:
 - A subscription section with a form.
### Footer:
 - Contains links to various sections of the page, as well as social media icons, the museum logo and the museum's schedule.

## Additional Features
- **Animations:** Consistent animation speeds for hover effects.
- **Form Placeholders:** Clear placeholders in forms suggesting what to enter.
- **Form Validation:** Ensures proper format for inputs and prevents empty submissions.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Added smooth scrolling for the whole page.
- **Favicon:** Included a favicon for the site.
- **Slider for Gallery:** Implemented a slider for viewing pictures in the gallery, optimized for mobile.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** For the structure of the page.
- **SCSS:** For styling and following BEM methodology.
- **JavaScript:** For interactive elements like the hamburger menu and slider.
- **npm:** For managing dependencies and running tasks.
